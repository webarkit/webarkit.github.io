## A vision for the future for open source WebAR

**WebAR Kit** was born because we wants take the best from the open source WebAR and push it to a new level.
Actually the **ARtoolkit** project is dead, and his successor **ARtoolkitX** is not so much web friendly: **Jsartoolkit5** is the javascript port of ARtoolkit and **ARtoolkitX.js** the corresponding version for ARtoolkitX. We want to develop a newer version derived from the two in a smarter
sdk especially designed for javascript.

We like the idea to augment almost any image you want, for this reason we will start by image tracking with **NFT** technology to face tracking, hand tracking and other technologies.

With the **WebARStudio** editor will be possible in few clicks of the mouse share a full WebAR app, this is our main idea and goal.
if you are a web developer, **AR** lover or a visual artist follow us in the development of our open source project, we will regularly share our progress on this page, on our Twitter account [@WebarkitO](https://twitter.com/WebarkitO) and on Facebook: [webarkit](https://www.facebook.com/webarkit)
If you are interested to contribute to the project join the group in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/2jK5sYSKbD)

More to come...
